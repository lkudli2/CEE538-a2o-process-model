# CEE538-a2o-process-model
This project used GPSx modeling software to evaluate process upgrades for the Peoria Wastewater Treatment Plant, replacing the existing aerobic configuration with an Anaerobic–Anoxic–Oxic (A2O) system for enhanced nutrient removal. Simulations tested different clarifier efficiencies, solids retention times (SRTs), and seasonal conditions to assess impacts on BOD, nitrogen, phosphorus, and aeration costs. The study provided operational recommendations on optimal SRT ranges, clarifier performance, and reactor configurations to achieve effluent quality targets.
